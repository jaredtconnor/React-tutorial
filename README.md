# React Tutorial
This is a tutorial broken to understand [React](https://reactjs.org) brought by following the 2021 instance of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). 

The project is broken into 12 parts: 
1. Intro and fundamentals of web apps
2. Intro to React
3. Communicating with the server
4. Programming a server with NodeJS/Express
5. Testing Express
6. Testing React
7. State Management with Redux
8. React router and web hooks
9. GraphQL
10. TypeScript
11. React Native
12. Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

The parts of this course are based on an iterative and a Mastery Learning pedogogic context, meaning, one should only continue to step `n+1` after they understand the contents of module `n`. 

I have covered an introduction to web development work with NodeJS and Express, so this repo will likely contain contents from the course focusing on the React portions of this learning material.
